                        Mahogany Box is a personal styling service for women. Complete a profile and let us know your
                        preferences, style, size, fit and budget by taking our Style Quiz. Letting us know how you currently dress, your
                        aspirations helps our styling team get to know you better. Request a box and let us know what you're looking for.
                        Understanding your current needs helps our styling team ensure a personalized experience for you. You'll pay a $20
                        styling fee, which is credited to your purchase. You'll receive a preview of your box before it ships to see what
                        our stylists have selected for you. You'll have the opportunity to make edits or confirm the box as is within 48 hours.
                        Once complete, your box will be on it's way. Try everything on from the comfort of your home within 5 days.
                        Keep what you love, send the rest back. Check out instantly online or in the app. Be sure to leave feedback for our
                        stylists. Exchanges and returns are always free. For ultimate convenience, schedule a free carrier pick up to return your box.

                    <p id="sign-up">
                        To sign up, create your profile online (it only takes a minute—seriously, we’ve timed it), or download the
                        Mahogany Box app on your iPhone or Android and get started from there. Either way, signing up is completely free.
                        On average, boxes will arrive within 8-14 business days. Once you request a box, a stylist will hand-select pieces
                        just for you and email you a box preview. You’ll have 48 hours to edit, approve, or cancel the order before it ships.
                        Once shipped, your box should arrive within 3-5 business days. Once your box arrives, you'll have five calendar
                        days to decide what to keep and what to send back. Boxes are sent depending on the frequency of your subscription.
